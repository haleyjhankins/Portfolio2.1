                <h2 class="blog-title">Miller's Law</h2>

                <p>
                  One thing I've learned while studying UX design is the fact that we as humans are simpletons. Our working memories aren't great, and we like keeping things nice and simple. Nick Miller of the T.V. show New Girl is a perfect example of a guy who keeps things simple.

                  <br>
                  <br>

                   So rather than rambling on and writing a long article for the sake of quantity, I'd like to adhere to Mr. (George) Miller's law by keeping this article short and sweet. So, look smart, ya dumbass. (Quote by Nick Miller, not George, the guy who created this theory.)

                   <br>
                   <br>

                   1. 1956, Miller came up with this rule that says that a person’s working memory can only hold roughly 5-9 items for approximately 10-15 seconds.

                   <br>
                   <br>

                   2. Many popular brands still violate Miller's Law. Adobe Illustrator is my favorite example. Rather than presenting their tools in chunks that relate to eachother, they present them as a list that exceeds the recommended 5-9 items.

                   <br>
                   <br>

                   3. The more features that are added to a product, the need for “good” interface design goes up.

                   <br>
                   <br>

                   4.Primacy & Recency Effect: Basically states that we are more likely to remember the beginning and end of a list.

                   <br>
                   <br>

                   Basically: “Millers law teaches us that humans have a finite amount of information they can process, and that information overload will lead to distraction that negatively affects performance.”

                <h2 class="blog-title">Measuring Facebook ROI in the B2B space.</h2>


<p> Most marketing managers won’t even consider adding social media to their marketing mix unless ROI can be proven in black and white. Many are under the impression that social media simply does not work in the B2B space, and that social is only good for customer service and personal use. This couldn’t be further from the truth; especially for my personal favorite platform– Facebook. Just think about this: as of July 2016, there are now 1.71 billion monthly active Facebook users. If you had any doubts, this should make it a little easier: Facebook is too big to ignore. Another thing to think about is Facebook’s superior ability to target specific audiences using paid placements. You can target based on job title, company, seniority and more. Better yet, Facebook paid placements have a much lower CPC than Google ads, which usually average $2.50 per click, while Facebook CPC generally hits below $0.75.

  <br>
  <br>

So what steps should you take to measure real ROI from Facebook and other social media platforms?

<br>
<br>

Make sure Facebook makes sense for your business in the first place. Know which platforms make sense for your audience. This should be assessed when creating buyer personas. Does the person you are trying to reach hang out on Facebook?
Understand which metrics actually matter. It’s easy to say “I want to use Facebook to generate leads.” While that’s totally obtainable, we need to get specific. Instead, our goal could be “My goal on is to promote my webinar on Facebook and reach 10,000 people, and of those people, I want to convert 10% of those leads.” In general, the three most important metrics are Page Likes, Post Reach and Engagement.
Use the right software to track your efforts. Google Analytics is a great free software to use. If you are new to it, there are plenty of resources out there to help you get a good grasp. Another good software that I have used personally is Hubspot. It is a great platform that allows you to schedule posts, listen to what your audience is saying about your brand and even has it’s own set of reports.

<br>
<br>

Social is not one-and-done. It is very important to focus on measuring and reporting on your findings frequently. A good practice would be to monitor your social campaigns at least once a week and to make tweaks as necessary. It is also important that you remain active on your Facebook page, replying to any comments from potential leads or brand advocates.
If you are anything like me and get frustrated when people tell you that Facebook and other social platforms are useless in the B2B space, this article should provide you with the ammunition to fire back.
